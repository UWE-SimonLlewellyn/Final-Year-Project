%This is for creating a full non binary solutions.
%CREATEPOP inital random population to intitiate the GA
%   population will consist of multiple random solutions based upon the
%   passed parameters.
%   each solution will hold co-ordinats [x,y] for each Tx for as many Tx
%   are used in that solution along with the fitness of the solution.
%   If total number of Tx ussed is less that maxNumTx the space will be 
%   filled with 0's and these will not show with in soltuion.

%   ------------------------------
%   Parameteres:
%   MaxNumTx : total amount of transmitters allowsed in a solution
%   popSize  : the size of the population to create 
%   grid     : the problem space has been devided into a grid showing 
%              this var hold the size (X-by-Y) of the grid
%   cellSpace: the total space allow between Tx in the grid
%   eg : MaxNumTx = 3, popsize = 3, grid = [2,5]
%   population = [{{2,3},{1,1}, {0,0}, 45},{{2,1},{2,5},{2,4}, 40},
